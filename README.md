üöó Branch Definitions
------
* Full: All the goodies and changes from me (like custom alerts, engagement in extra gears, nudgeless ALC) and overall quality-of-life fixes included.
* Clean: Core code from two different forks merged together with little to no additions from me whatsoever. Same as if found in the wild.
* Coasting: Only works well on Hondas & GMs. Branch has the functionality to coast beyond the set speed (including downhills) instead of using the brakes.
* Devel: Branches in development. Check the commit history to see what's being worked on. No stability guarantees.
* Personal: Branches used on my own fleet of cars. No stability guarantees.
* Shane: Includes some or all of Shane's fork abilities: https://github.com/sshane/openpilot
* DP: Includes Dragonpilot as the core. Dragonpilot has many different customization options accessible from the UI: https://github.com/dragonpilot-community/dragonpilot
* Spektor: Lane keeping assist can be activated independently of adaptive cruise control. Only for Hondas before 0.8.6, Toyota support added recently.
* Honda: Honda-specific branch that utilizes the follow distance selector on the steering wheel to specific profiles. Not recommended for other cars.

Example: `0.8.6-dp-spektor-toyota` would contain Dragonpilot as the core, Spektor's independent LKAS and ACC, and tested to work on Toyotas.  
Example: `0.8.2-shane-spektor` would contain [https://github.com/sshane/openpilot](Shane) as the core, plus Spektor's independent LKAS and ACC for Hondas.  
Example: `0.8.6-release-honda` is designed specifically for Honda's follow distance selector. Other cars would see no benefit.  
  
üöó Installation  
------
* Some branches (especially DP) are known to not work well without a factory reset first. Failing to do so may have errors or conflicts later on. [Check this video for instructions on how to factory reset.](https://youtu.be/0MPv_hSH3hk?t=98)
* If using the Dragonpilot branch, enable "Allow Gas Pressed" in the controls settings to work with the standalone LKAS function properly.
* Install via URL: https://smiskol.com/fork/aragon7777/REPLACE_WITH_BRANCH_NAME
* Install via SSH: `cd /data; cp -rf ./openpilot ./openpilot.bak; rm -rf ./openpilot; git clone https://github.com/Aragon7777/openpilot.git openpilot; cd openpilot; git checkout REPLACEWITHBRANCHNAME && reboot`
* If a NEOS upgrade or downgrade is required, it's always best to factory reset and install stock Openpilot for that specific NEOS version. After that, proceed.

‚Ü™Ô∏è Spektor56 behavior explained:
------
* Honda and Toyota: Behavior like stock Honda Sensing, thanks to Spektor56. 
*      LKAS and ACC are two seperate functions that can be used independently.
*           LKAS: Lane-keeping-assist-system.
*           LKAS is activated using the LKAS button the steering wheel.
*           LKAS is active when the built in HUD lanelines are solid. 
*           LKAS is inactive when the built in HUD lanelines are outlined.
*           LKAS will disengage on brake, but automatically come back.
*           LKAS will disengage below the Auto Lane Change (ALC) speed with blinker.
*           LKAS will stay disengaged briefly after blinkers, this helps driver recenter wheel.
*           LKAS will stay disengaged if seatbelt unlatched, door open, or unsupported gear.
*           ACC: Adaptive cruise control.
*           ACC is activated using the SET or RES(ume) button on the steering wheel.
*           ACC will disengage on brake, and never automatically come back until reset by the driver.
*           ACC can be adjusted in increments of 1MPH or +5MPH by holding, even with a (Honda) comma pedal.
*           ACC will not engage if seatbelt unlatched, door open, or unsupported gear.

‚Ü©Ô∏è Dragonpilot (DP) Notes:
------
* In order to get follow and acceleration profiles, you must enable them in the settings. Only then will the selectors show up while the car is on.
* (Coming Soon): My personal settings.

üöó General features across all branches (other than clean):
------
* Alerts have mostly been rewritten. Better grammar, less annoying, and more details on specific events.
* Engagement sounds have been muted. For moderate or major warnings, the Tesla warning sound will play.
* Update prompt forcing an internet connection to check for updates has been disabled.
* Engagement in gears other than drive, such as sport and low.
* Reduced the potentional for false driving model lagging alerts.
